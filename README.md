# Weekend SQL To-Do List

## Description
This application allows users to add tasks, mark tasks complete, and delete tasks off a list. It also allows for due dates to be entered to organize tasks by urgency.

## Installation
Create a database named "todo". See database.sql file in order to copy and paste text to recreate table for app. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. It is recommended to use Postico to run queries as that was used to create the queries,
<!-- npm install moment --save NOT USED -->
```npm init --yes ```
<!--cant get these ot be on new lines...-->

```npm install express --save ```

```npm install pg --save```

## Usage
In order to add something to the task table, simply enter a task name into the input labeled 'Task Name'.
Note that the notes field as well as the due date field are not required to fill out.
Your task should appear on the table. Then, at your leisure, you may delete the task or mark it as complete.
