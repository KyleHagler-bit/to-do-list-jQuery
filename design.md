Decided to take out column of "status" since columns like date completed and the mark complete button with checkmark should accomplish the goal of letting the user know about the state of the task.
If needed, a seperate status column could be entered to display either "complete" or "not complete" with a possible third option of having  atask be "in progress".

The only data that is required to be entered is the task name. This is because some task names will not need notes alongside it nor have a dedicated due date.
